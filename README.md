# Simple Sales Dashboard Design
For this task, I analyzed a sales dashboard to extract key insights from the provided data. I reviewed total sales, profit, and profit margin figures, then broke down monthly trends, regional performance, and category contributions using the visual charts. I used Excel to interpret the data, focusing on the bar charts for regional sales and pie chart for categories, as well as the line graph for monthly trends. I learned to identify patterns, such as peak sales months and top-performing regions, while practicing data summarization. The process helped me enhance my skills in data analysis and presentation, preparing a concise summary for stakeholder communication. I also ensured accuracy by cross-checking figures and trends across the dashboardÂ sheets.
